Development roadmap

1st Generation
- Python
- Fetched data on questions, showing me new questions and simplistically
  finding trading opportunities

2nd Generation
- Python
- Attempts to find optimal trades, for ill-defined definitions of optimal,
  based on manually determined outcome beliefs
- Can look at trading history and trader scores to automatically determine
  a plausible belief without input. Relies on the fact that we're in a
  prediction market which is currently inefficient.

3rd Generation
- Switch to Racket
- Plan is to implement the same functionality as 2nd Gen
- Better SW engineering
- Provide tools for feedback (plots!) on trading opportunities for each
  question

4th Generation
- Hopefully determine the nature of the various "optimal" trades based
  on feedback from 3rd Generation. Provide those as defaults.
- Allow trading strategies to be specified on a per-question basis

5th Generation
- Account for "time value of points"
- Automatic determination of appropriate trading strategies depending
  on the question
- Fancy user interface?

6th Generation
???
